# This foulder holds some of the early versions of the TPS LabVIEW programs.
# CurrentVsTime.vi is a program that controls the temperature of a sample as a function of time.
  # It works by having the LabVIEW NI card output a voltage which controls a Kepco powersupply's heating current.
  # The input thermocouple voltage passes through a x100 multiplier before letting the LabVIEW read the current temperature.
  # The PID inputs allow for optimization of the heating rate, control functions, and/or target temperature

# MultiscanXPS is a labVIEW program that uses a NI USB-6001 card to control XPS hardware from phi electronics. 
  # additional details in disertation
  # Allows for multiple binding energy ranges, dVs, and signal averaging methods to be utilized.
    # See TPS rolling averages SOP manual for additional details

# TempRamp is described in Molecular_electronics folder. Read the readme there.

# Untitled 3 (SubVI).vi is the sub VI labVIEW program that allows the above programs to funciton properly.
  # Place this program on the desktop and designate a pathway during inital setup
